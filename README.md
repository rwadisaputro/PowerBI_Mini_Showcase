### PowerBI Mini Showcase

###### This repo contains a simple PowerBI-based visualization for a quick showcase of my familiarity & usage using it. Source raw data is ticker stock data via Alpha Vantage REST API and what is being visualized is the possibility of using the contained ticker data to extract a smoothened out longer-term view of the stock price trend. This could prove useful for a forecasting and/or machine learing context, for example. Everyone is welcome to download the PBIX file.

###### As demonstrated in the file, it is possible to extract the stock price trend in a reasonably close manner.
