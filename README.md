### PowerBI Mini Showcase

###### This repo contains a simple PowerBI-based visualization for a quick showcase of my familiarity and usage using it. There are two showcases:

###### 1) Source raw data is ticker stock data via Alpha Vantage REST API and what is being visualized is the possibility of using the contained ticker data to extract a smoothened out longer-term view of the stock price trend that is achieved by taking the daily averages from the respective ticker data. This could prove useful for a forecasting and/or machine learing context, for example. A Python file for the API call and manipulating the data is also included. As demonstrated in the file, it is possible to extract the stock price trend in a reasonably close manner. Everyone is welcome to download the PBIX file as well as the Python file for experimentation.

###### 2) Excerpt report for a co-op work term analyzing the impacts to traffic travel time and speed after a toll route cessation. An excerpt case study report and the Power BI generated charts as PBIX file are included.
